#TwilinIt
This repo contains a very, very basic application that sends a text to a number using Twilio's API. **This code should not be used in any production environment**. It asks the user to define his/her Auth Token and other user specific information in order to make the request. It should only be used as a demonstation of the miracle of sending a text by the press of a button.

The project was built by Manav Kohli, a senior at Claremont McKenna College. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:manavk123@gmail.com).
